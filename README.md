## Problem statement
Activity is on the decline and populations have adapted to remain inside. Isolation and limited exercise are the leading contributors to physical health risks,  depression and other mental health issues. Overall quality of life, for all ages, across all regions are at risk as the world continues to face COVID, declining economies, inflation, threats and war.   

## Solution
We’re building a move-to-earn dapp. This incentives movement IRL, and participate in localized events - all while earning $MATIC, which they can burn to evolve their soul-based NFT.

This also solves the problem of bridging people from web2 to web3 by providing a low-lift and low-barrier-to-entry application that introduces them to the world of web3 in a fun way where they benefit at the same time. We believe this type of introduction to web3 will allowless technical people to feel comfortable getting involved and understanding the major benefits and potential the web3 world has. 

## User Experience
- User is onboarded to the dapp with a Coinbase Wallet
- Once onboarded, they’ll get the base of their soul-bound NFT airdropped to them
- When the user starts to move, they’ll earn Matic.
- They’ll want to earn Matic because they’ll need to burn Matic to level up their soul-bound NFT. And leveling up their soul-bound NFT means they get exclusive access to mental, fitness-oriented services, events, merch & education.
- People will want to keep their soul-bound NFTs because it’s all about reputation over identity. Over time their soul-bound NFT will be emblematic of their investment to not only their fitness & mental health, but also their community’s.
- Once they’re done moving, they can look at the dapp to see both their soul-bound NFT, as well as everyone else’s.
